# Oscar-winners
Web scrape of Oscar nominees and winners between 2010 and 2019

This project was created and completed for a class project in the Spring of 2019. 

The first part required identifying parent and child groups, and then identify the relevant fields and HTML output for content mapping. 
Once located, multiple functions were written to print the data in an appropriate format. The format, and later data output, that was 
created was 'category', 'movie', 'name', 'winner', and 'year'. After writing the code for 2019, I scraped the same categorical 
information throughout the past decade, where the data was then put into a data frame using pandas. Finally, the 1213 rows x 5 column 
data frame was exported into Excel for further analysis.
